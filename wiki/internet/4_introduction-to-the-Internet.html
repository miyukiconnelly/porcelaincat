            <h2>What is the Internet?</h2>

            <h3>How does the Internet Work?</h3>

            <p>The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.</p>

            <p>In the video below, Vint Cerf, one of the “fathers of the internet,” explains the history of how the Internet works and how no one person or organization is really in charge of it.</p>

            <h2>Wires, Cables, and Wi-Fi</h2>

            <h3>How does the information move on the internet?</h3>

            <p>Information on the Internet moves from one computer to another in the form of bits over various mediums, including Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, and wireless signals (i.e., radio waves).</p>

            <p>In the video linked below, you will learn about the different mediums for data transfer on the Internet and the pros and cons for each.</p>

            <h2>IP Addresses and DNS</h2>

            <h3>How do the networks talk to each other and the protocols involved?</h3>

            <p>Now that you know about the physical medium for the data transfer over the internet, it’s time to learn about the protocols involved. How does the information traverse from one computer to another in this massive global network of computers?</p>

            <p>In the video below, you will get a brief introduction to IP, DNS, and how these protocols make the Internet work.</p>

            <h2>Packets, Routing, and Reliability</h2>

            <h3>What’s the relationship between packets, routers, and reliability?</h3>

            <p>Information transfer on the Internet from one computer to another does not need to follow a fixed path; in fact, it may change paths during the transfer. This information transfer is done in the form of packets and these packets may follow different routes depending on certain factors.</p>

            <p>In this video, you will learn about how the packets of information are routed from one computer to another to reach the destination.</p>
